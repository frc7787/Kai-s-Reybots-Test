                        The Reynolds Reybots are a school-based team that designs and builds competition robots. The team meets year-round and operates like a small business, with different sub-teams that handle everything from marketing and fundraising to programming, mechanics, and electrical work. We operate on an apprenticeship model, where more experienced students lead and mentor more junior students to gain the skills and knowledge required. The collaborative effort of running a team and building and competing with robots provides a real world learning environment that is fun, exciting, and rewarding. As FIRST® founder Dean Kamen said, &quot;We don’t use kids to build robots. We use robots to build kids.&quot;<br /><br />

                        FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded in 1989 to inspire young people’s interest in science and technology. The not-for-profit organization designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills. The Reybots participate in the two highest levels of competition, FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC) and FIRST® Tech Challenge (FTC). Please see our website, Reybots.ca, for more information on our specific team.<br /><br />

                        Universities and employers recognize the crucible that FIRST® participants have been fired through, value their experience and skills, and actively recruit such students. Participation in robotics provides students with exposure to real world applications of math, science, and technology that are often missing from their academic classes, and motivates students for participation in post-secondary STEM programs. Graduated students from the Reynolds Robotics Team have gone on to attend programs in Computer Science, Engineering, Science, and Trades.<br /><br />

                        We are looking for sponsors who will cheer us on year after year and ultimately become part of the Reynolds Reybots family. How the funds will be used can be seen in the chart below. Because this is an extracurricular activity, this would not be possible without grants and generous donations from generous people and companies like you/yours. Sponsors for Reybots make a positive contribution to the education, well-being, and eventual careers of students who get to participate. Upwards of 30 children participate in some role every year during the competition season and we hope to grow this.<br /><br />

                        Our sponsorship goal for 2022-2023 is to raise $15,000. Sponsor money received will go directly towards the expenses required to run the team each year, including competition registration, parts, tools, and travel. <br /><br />
